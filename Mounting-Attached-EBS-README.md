following command to install the XFS tools and then repeat teh previous command.

Use mkdir command to create a mount point directory for the volume. The mount point ois where the volume is located in the file treee and where you read and write files to, after you mount teh volume.

           sudo mkdir /data
           
           sudo mkdir /app

Mount the volume or partition at the mount point directory you created in the previous step. If the volume has no partition, use the following command specify the name to mount the entire volume.

           sudo mount /dev/xvdf /data

If the volume has partition, use the following command and specify the partition name to mount a partition.

            sudo mount /dev/xvdf1 /data 

To unmount a volume, use the below command.

         sudo unmount /data
