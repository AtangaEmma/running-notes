                                 LINUX  2
                               =============
REVIEW OF LAST CLASS

i hope every body was able to create a server and access it?
In our last class we saw that to create an instance/server, we need an account in aws
and we saw that aws stands for amazon web services, we also saw that to create an account in AWS
we need some certain credentials which include

      -email address
      -username	
      -password
      -credit card
      -address(postcode)
We saw how we can log in our AWS ACCOUNT by using
      
       -root user email address
       -password
we saw how we can log in our AWS account and create an instance/server by

       -searching for AWS ec2 service console
       -launce your linux ec2 instance/VM/server
       -we need a server to run task for clients
        
Apart of this, we saw how we can connect to our created instance/server, and to do that we need,
      
      -a computer  e.g windows system
      -an ssh  (secure shell) client software/protocol (mobaxterm)
      -the servers details 
          the servers public/private ip
          usernanme
          password/ssh private keypair
      -open ssh port 22 on the servers firewall 

 Those with the mac operating system
      ssh -i keypair user@ipaddress
  
DEMO
  server creation and how members can connect to it
log into AWS account , launch an instance and connect to it
in doing this, demonstarate all steps explaining all steps
make known of the fact that servers don't have the same ip

Now that we are connected to our server we can now run task


 THE LINUX FILE STRUCTURE
==========================

                      WINDOWS         LINUX
                    . fILES          .fILES         
                    . FOLDERS        .DIRECTORIES
                    .SUD-FOLDERS     .SUB-DIRECTORIES
ROOTS Directory       c:\                /
in the windows file structure, the principal directory is (c:) this implies that everything you do in windows 
begins with (c), while in linux it is a forward slash (/)
A directroy/folder is a container that contains files and sub-folders

LINUX FILE STRUCTURE

linux root directroy = /

some few basic commands 
              
              ls  = list the content of a directory
              pwd = present working directory
              hostname = tell you the hostname of your server
if i run the command 
                  sudo hostname set-hostname demo  = it will change the host name of the server
to view changes, we switch to a user
                  sudo su - ec2-user 
now you will the our hostname has been changed

So now if we exrcute 'ls' which stands for list the content of the directory, 
       
           e.g     ls /
   
we will find out that the linux root directory has some content in it, lets run and see

DEMO 
    ls /   copy the content of it and explain the content of what is in the important directories

 e.g  

1) bin - contains binary files(commands) like ls, pwd, clear, cd, touch, mkdir etc
   
         Some other simple command that we will running include

             cd    =  change directory
             touch = creates a file
             mkdir = creates a directory
DEMO
    cd / and list its content with ls

home directory - contains users home directory details
     run the command ls /home  = this will list the content of the home derictroy

[ec2-user@demo ~]$ ls /home
ec2-user

now if we run the command - adduser = this will add a new user to our server
here we have learn another new command, lets try and see, not everybody can add 
a user to the server, so we need some privileges, in linux , we say you need root access
or sudo access, 
sudo simply means you are running the task as the root user
now if we run 
            sudo adduser emma
it will create a new user in our server called emma 
we can even add as many users as we wish, say; president, dominion, obi etc

if we now run the command ls /home, we will find that all the users we added to our server are 
stored in the /home directory
so lets now run ls /home and see what we have there

let us check at one other directory

2) sbin = this directory contain system binary files/commands
we talked about the bin directory containing binary files, similally the sbin contains binary 
file but these files/commands can only be executed by the admin users or root users 
e.g adduser, create passwd to users, change name of server etc


IQ
  what is the difference between bin and sbin directories in linux
ANSWER
    sbin are binary files only exwecutable by users with administrative or elevated privileges
    or admin/root user while bin are binary files executable by any user

3) etc = contains configuration files
        /etc/shadow           = contains passwd of users
        /etc/passwd           = contains users imformation
        /etc/ssh/sshd_config  = ssh configuration details - determines if someone will use an ssh key or passwd

4) tmp = contains temporal files
         if you want to create some temporally files, this is where to create

5) opt = where software and packages are install
          install and download all packages/software in this directory

6) lib = library files
          put all library files here

7) var = contains dynamic files
          /var/log/messages  
   this contains dynamic files like log, what ever is happening in your server is recorded in the log file
e.g if you are unable to access your your server , there are some files e.g var/log/messages that you can go there to check

8) proc = contains information about our server, the hardware component
          meminfo
          cpuinfo
 

                          SIMPLE/BASIC LINUX COMMANDS
                        ================================
Run task/wprkload using commands
if we don't want to use commands we can use GUI
if you are using GUI , you are going to be paid something like [$30k-$60k]
but with the CLI , you are to be automating task for your client 
with this you will be paid like $100k upward 

we know that a directory/folder is a container that contains files
we have a new client = atango

You are given anew ticket to carry out task for ur client

TICKET 001
       create work directories for atango
they want you to create a directory called
       1) devops
       2) dev/maven/git/aws/nexus/java     


     CREATING, NAVIGATING AND MANAGING DIRECTORIES

The first command is

       mkdir =  will creates a directory

if yopu creates a wrong directory , you can delete the directory with
     rmdir = this command will deletes an empty directory(no content)

if the directory has content, we delete it with
      rm -rf - deletes a directory with content

now if i want to navigate from one directory to another, the command is
         cd

to know my present working directroy, the command is 
          pwd

listing the content of a directory, the command is 
          ls

Run a command mkdir -v directiryname
where -v = verbose mode

DEMO
    illustrate series of directory creations and demonstrations

To create a directory in this formate, dev/maven/git/was/nexus/java,  
we need to add -p , where -p stands for creating both the parent and child directory
i.e 
    mkdir -p directories or mkdir -vp directories

when you create a directory like this and run the command 'ls' , you only see the parent
directory, to see all the directories, we will run a command call the 
   tree - command
when we do this, the system will tell us that command not found,
here we can install the tree command using the a package manager called 'yum' , but to execute
this command, you must have root privileges/admin by using sudo, do not forget that when you use 
sudo, it permits you to switch or run commands as another user
so to install the tree command, run

         sudo yum install tree
DEMO
    how to install the tree command and use it to list the directories
deletes some created directories and do more demonstrations

LET US SEE HOW WE CAN NAVIGATE DIRECTORIES 
We navigate directories by using the cd command

DEMO
    demonstrate how we can move from one directory to another,
demonstrate how to navogate directories as dev/maven/git/was/nexus/java
i.e 
    cd ..
    cd ../..
    cd ../../..
    cd ../../../..        
    cd ../../../../..

you may have to switch from one directory to another so please take note

if i do ls pwd = it will list the content of my present working directory
le dev = list the content in the dev directory
ls /home = list the content of the /home directory
le /dev = list the content of the /dev home director
