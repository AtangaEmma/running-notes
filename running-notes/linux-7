                        LINUX 7 NOTES

All these while we have been looking on some linux commands and we discussed that
as a DevOPs engineer, our work is to ;

             develop            - applications
             build              - applications
             test               - applications
             review & qualify   - applications
             secure             - applications
             access             - applications
             deploy             - applications
             maintain           - applications
             manage & monitor   - applications
We realise that to accomplish all these tasks, we need computerise solutions
and for us to us computerise solutions, that means computers are involve and we 
saw that a computer is made up of two components,
       
       the hardware
       the software

and these tasks are being done either by using the;

          GUI
          CLI

                 PACKAGE MANAGEMENT 

Here we download packages and/or softwares to ease our task
download the following packages

    ssh client: mobaxterm, puTTY, gitbash
    text editor: sublime-text, brackets, vs-code, notepad++
    study platforms: zoom, telegram, whatsApp desktop

these softwares will make your computer to give you the study experience you need

Package management is a big deal when we are trying to automate automation
in linux we have some text editors such as 
    vim, nano,
some these editors are packages that need  to be install in our server
we can use these text editors to modify our files

For us to install a package, we use package managers
examles of package managers include;
    yum/dnf    = package managers for redhat/centOS
    rpm        = general package manager for redhat systems
    chocolatey = package manager for windows
    apt        = package manager for Debian/Ubuntu 
 
Now in aws, we have created a redhat server, so can install our packages 
Note that when you install packages, it can do some changes in you server
let me ask you this question, should any user be able to install packages in the server?
the answer is NO, so to install packages, you need sudo access
i.e 
          sudo yum install package/packages

To auto approve the process, use the -y flag at the end
i.e 
         sudo yum install package/packages -y 

After we install a package and no longer need it again, we can delete it;
   
          sudo yum/dnf remove package    

To download packages from the internet, we use the ;
       
          wget = non interactive network downloader

DEMO
     - install packages
     - install wget and downoad a package e.g apache maven

In our last class when we talk the linux file structure, we saw that packages should be installed
in the opt directory, so the recommended directory for us to always download packages should be the 
opt directory, everything in the opt directory is oen by the root user so to install any package there,
root access id required
 
We are explaining the fack that when it comes to linux, you experince is managing packages
and we can also manage process as well

DEMO
    - diagramatical illustrating of users connected to a server ding different tasks , like
      five of them, managingfiles, managingpackages, managingsystem, managingservice, 
      managingprocess, backingup data etc

Anything that we do in the server is a process in linux thus the need for process management

                PROCESS MANAGEMENT

             FileMGT
             UserMGT
             ProcessMGT
             SecurityMGT
             PackageMGT
             ServiceMGT
             SystemMGT
             Monitiring
             dbBackup

Tasks are processes running in the system
we have commands here like;

       top command

DEMO
     run the top command and explain while laying emphasis on load average
     be remimded of the fact that load average is on 1

IQ
   what is load average in linux
ANSWER
      the load average tells you how much load a system is carrying

To make sure that your system don't break, load average should be highly considered,
this is because, when the load average is high, the server can come down or will run
very slowly

    
Every task/workload we do on the linux server is a process, by such;
processmgt is very important,
its through processmgt that we can know and correct the state at which our server is 
running, processes that have no use in the service can slow down the server and make 
it to malfunction or slow down, e.g of such processe are the zombie processes or the process with z in STAT column


the 'ps', 'ps -ef', 'ps -f', command will display the state of all processes in ur server

NOTE: Every process has an ID known as the process ID [PID]

if we find out that there is a process in the server that is not useful, we can kill the process
 by using the 'kill PID' command and the process will be killed

i.e

kill PID = kills a process with said ID

HOW TO FIND IF A PROCESS IS NO LONGER USEFUL BEFORE DELETING
=============================================================

We run the command;
'ps - aux' = this will display the content of processes running in the server, look for the column with 
letter 'Z' and kill the process by using the PID as shown above

or better still, we can run the command

ps -aux | grep Z = this command will display all processes that are in the zombie state. showing the process
 id [PID] , parent process id [PPID] and the command that was use to start the process  

HOW TO KILL A zombie PROCESS
=================================
We run the command;   

'kill PID' = this will eliminate the zombie process and thus speeds up ur server

To forcefully kill the process; run,

'kill -9 PID' = it will forcefully delete the process if the later did not work 

Istall apache httpd and check if the servive is running

         ps -ef | grep httpd
         
DEMO
    - do illustrate more examples
    
                 
                      SERVICE MANAGEMENT
      
      service servicename arguements
      service servivename start/stop/status/enable/disable/restart
      
      systemctl arguements servicename
      systemctl start/stop/status/enable/disable/restart servicename

DEMO 
     start some services, check their status

Q
      Exlain your expereince with linux systems
      ==========================================

My experience with linux systems include;
    1) deploying, povisioning and creating linux servers in AWS cloud,
       connect to servers using - ssh protocol

    2) configuring, optimising, commissioning, decommissioning and securing linux servers

    3) running workloads in linux servers/systems using;
            GUI
            CLI
            SCRIPTS
   
     examples of workload/tasks executed include

             FileMGT
             UserMGT
             ProcessMGT
             SecurityMGT
             PackageMGT
             ServiceMGT
             SystemMGT
             Monitiring
             dbBackup

We commission a server by installing the application software in the server
and decommissioning is uninstalling the software 

As we move on with the course, we will see how to automate task using scripts and cron table

with cron tables we will see how to schedule and automate tasks
we say something like 
 1) Backup all databases every midnight
 2) desplay the latest version of the application every sunday at midnight
 3) optimise our appservers every month on the 28th day
      like ; yum update -y && yum upgrade -y
 4) monitor system resources and sent send alert using threshold every minute
      like ; if cpu/mem usage exceed 80% sent email df -h = cpu

these are the kind of tasks we are going to be seeing through out the course

  ARCHIVE/DATA BACKUP COMMANDS

To backup database, we either copy the file or we zip or tar the file
i.e
       zip   =  package and compress(archive) files
       unzip = Extract compressed files in zip archive
       tar   = use to archive a directory/file

DEMO
     - vim into a file with much content and zip the file
     - install the zip package
     - zip file to a file called filename.zip
     i.e
         zip newfilename.zip filename
    
     - compare the volume of storage consummed by the file and the zip file 
Note when you zip a file, there is no need to keep the original copy, so you delete it,
because if the file still exist, you will not be able to unzip the file

to tar a file, we run;

      tar -cvf newfilename.tar.gz filename  =  compress a file
      
      tar -xvf filename.tar.gz              =  extract compressed *.tar.gz file 

DEMO
     ceate a tar file and extract the file


You ahve a blocker, how will you resolve it
==============================================
1) check company's documentation--- running/pdf notes , videos
2) contact team members
3) use AI platforms [google, youtube, chartPGT
4)communities
