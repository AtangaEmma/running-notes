                   LINUX 8 NOTES

 So far we have been looking at commands on how to make you exel
as far as your being an engineer is concern, you have to have a 
good mastery of these commands, And don't bother before you know it, 
you will be singing the song of what prompted you to study this course 

From all that we have seen so far, today we will be rounding up with 
linux commands which is the base and a very good foundation to DevOps

As a DevOps engineer i work with my team to;

     delop
     test
     build
     review/qualify
     secure
     deploy
     maintain and monitor
software and applications using computerised automated technologies

DEMO
     detail explaination of what is the job of a DevOps engineer

To accomplish all these, we discused that we use computarise solutions 
which implies the use odf computers and we saw that a computer consist 
of;
     the hardware (cpu, keyboard, mouse, etc) 
     the software (operating system OS)

We run different tasks on our servers to manage applications
workload executed in application managenment
===========================================================

   1) usermgt
   2) files/codes = filemgt
   3) securitymgt
   4) processmgt
   5) systemmgt
   6) packagemgt      
DEMO

HOW TO EXECUTE WORKLOAD
========================    
    
    1) GUI = graphical user interface = less than $90k
    2) CLI = command line interface   = more than $150k 
    3) SCRIPTS ( a sctipt is a reusable code/file) = $200k 

So far we ahve executed commands and commands are going to help you achieve 
your tasks with relative ease

Now lets look on some other commands

OTHER COMMANDS
===============

DEMO
    connect to a server and demo a couple of users connected to 
    the server from their systems and outline what they need to 
    connect to the server, 

For users to connect to a server, there is a process called sshd  
service must be running before you can connect to the server

e.g
    somebody tells you that he/she is unable to log into the server 
    with all credentials correct, expalin what could be the problem

           1) check if the user is running the ssh command correectly
                     
                      ssh username@ipadderss

           2) check if ssh port 22 is open on the firewall/security group

           3) check if the server is up and running  
                  
                 ping the server

           4) check if the sshd service is running, if not start the service 

              sudo systemctl status sshd = to check the service
                
              sudo systemctl start sshd = to start the service 

Lets now look at some other commands
1) clear = this command will clear the terminal screen

2)   cal  = this command is use to check/set the calender on the server

e.g       
        cal june 2023 = will give you the calenda of june 2023
        cal july 1982 = will give you the calenda of that year

if you want to know the day that you were born in the week; run the cal command

3) wget  = this is a none interactive network downloader user to download files
           from the internet

   e.g  
       there is a time that you want to download a package, the system interacts with you;
  i.e
      ask you if what you want to do is ok by you,
That process of the system asking if you are ok or not is known as interaction,
here we say the system is interacting with you

We can still as well ignore the interaction by using the -y flag

WE HAVE LEARN THAT IF WE WANT TO DOWNLOAD ANYTHING, WE SHOULD DO IT IN THE [opt] DIRECTORY
i.e = cd into the 'opt' directory and download what u want to download from the internet there 


4) echo = this command prints what ever you type

5) tee  = this command is use to store and view the output of any command at the time   

    e.g
        run on the terminal,
                            echo "at 360k a year i am rich"
                            echo "with DevOps i'm a millionaire"        
        demo the echo message and re-direct to a file call rich
        cat the file rich, pipe and tee newfilename

6) hostory = this command displays the ecently executed commands
           = all the commands that we have been ruuning are stored here

7) watch = this command is use periodically 
          - with this command you watch what is happening to youe file system
            or your memory
       
               watch df -h  = checks file system
               watch free -m  = to check your memory  
     
Take note; this command is very good for file monitoring

8) ping = this command sents ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network host,
          - checks for network connectivity
         e.g
             i have a database server i want to check, are you alive? 

9) telnet    = a server uses ports and protocols,
               the number of ports in a server/system/computer are 0-65536 ports[addresses] by default
               So any server that you create has these number of ports/addresses 
           e.g
               if somebody tell you he/she can't access his/her server, you can check if the required port
               that the server is running is open

                               telnet server-ipaddress portnumber 



10) reboot =   this command will reboot the server and it also need sudo access

11) restart =  this command is use to restart the server and it requires sudo access,
                take note that when you reboot/restart a server, the ipaddress of the
                server can change 

12) shutdown = this command is executed with sudo access
             - use to shutdown the system
             - you will find a warning while try to run the command

13) uname   = this command will describ your system
           
             uname -a = tell you all information about your server

             cat /etc/*release  = tell you detailed information about your server

             cat /etc/*os*   = tell you detailed information about your server


14) netstat   = remember the number of ports in a server/system/computer are 0-65536 ports[addresses] by default
                       So any server that you create has these number of ports/addresse
                     - with the help of this command i can know how many ports that are in use
                     - let assum that we want to install ngnix, and nginx is using port 80/443,
                       so for you to know the ports that are in use before installing an application 
                       that runs on a particular port number, we use netstat command to check if the
                       port is in use or not, this is because if that port is already in use, that package
                       will not be able to run
   NOTE 
       if you run netstat and the system tell you command not found, you can install the command by running
                            
                  sudo yum install net-tools -y = will install netstat command
  
Now we can check the ports by running,

                    netstat -tulpn  = will list all the ports in use

                    t = tcp
                    u = udp
                    l = listening 
                    p = port
                    n = number

     protocols        ports/address
       ssh                 22
       http                80
       https               443
       nfs                 2089
       rdp                 3089 
       smtp                25/465/587
       tomcat              8080
       jenkins             8080
   
 15) man = diplays the on-line manual type
          - tells you everthing about what a command does
      e.g
          run,  
              man ls

16) help  =  helps you on how to use a command

17) info = helps you with information about a command
          - make sure you install the info command before executing

18) whatis  = diplaces the manual page of a command

19) service = it will give the status of service

             service sshd start
             systemctl start sshd

20) systemctl list-unit-files   =  it will list all services

21) uptime  = tells how long a server has been up and running 

When it comes to linux commands , i think we have come to the end of all
that is required you know as far as this course is concern

We have come to the end of the first MODULE
Our next MODULE will be SCRIPTING
In the MODULE, we will be learning how tasks are being automated to 
a higher level
